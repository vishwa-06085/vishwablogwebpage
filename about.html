        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Vishwa</strong>, a second-year <strong>Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE)</strong> student at <strong>Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm a curious, kind-hearted, and humble individual with a passion for learning, building projects, and creating quotes. My goal is to secure a position in a reputable product-based company, while also exploring opportunities in software development and web technologies.</p>
